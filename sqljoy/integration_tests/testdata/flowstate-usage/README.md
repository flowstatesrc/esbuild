A dummy project illustrating the range of code that can be correctly handled by the Flow State compiler.

Also includes some code samples that are valid, but not handled due to limitations of the compiler (limitations.js)

As well as some code samples that are invalid (invalid.js)

We use this as an integration test for the Flow State compiler by comparing the generated output to the expected output.
